                                last day of the promotional month, you can
                                purchase additional credits to proceed with the booking. However if it's after
                                promotional month, you will have
                                to make the $100 security deposit before topping up the balance of your booking
                                cost. If you run into negative
                                balance, your future bookings will ALL be cancelled.
